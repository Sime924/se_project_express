# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

#### Tech

For this project i used mongo.db and postman to help assist with my request that i was sending to the server. also separating breaking down all my files into new modules to help make the code easier to read.

##### Application

currently in this present state the backend has not been applied to the WTWR project as of yet, all code for this project can be found on my github at the project link below.
